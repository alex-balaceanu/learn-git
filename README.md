When you are working on a feature branch and want to merge it into the main branch, but changes have been made to the main branch in the meantime, you might encounter merge conflicts. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to resolve conflicts:

    Commit or Stash Changes:
        Before attempting to merge, make sure your changes in the feature branch are committed or stashed. This ensures a clean working directory.

    bash


bash

git merge main

If there are conflicting changes, Git will inform you about the conflicts.

Resolve Conflicts:

    Open the files with conflicts in your code editor. Git will mark the conflicting sections. Manually resolve the conflicts by editing the files to include the desired changes.

Mark as Resolved:

    After ressdadsdawdgdawcscxzwolving the conflicts, mark the files as resolved.

bash

git add .

Complete the Merge:

    Complete the merge.

bash

git merge --continue

or

bash

git commit -m "Merge branch 'main' into feature-branch"

Push the Changes:

    Push the merged changes to the remote repository.

bash

    git push origin feature-branch

Now, your feature branch includes both your changes and the changes from the main branch, and it's up-to-date with the latest main branch updates. This process ensures a smooth integration of your feature while resolving any conflicts that may arise.

bash

git checkout feature-branch

Merge Main into Feature Branch:
